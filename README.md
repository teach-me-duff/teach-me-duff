Explaining elimit.py, my first program.
I began learning to program as a teacher. I was teaching Advanced Algebra with Financial Applications and wanted to show the 
students were the irrational number e came from, so I wrote my first independent program, tiny as it is.  I showed the students
the code, explained what was happening, then started it.  Meanwhile we learned about calculating continuously compounding interest
and in the background the numbers were getting closer and closer to e in the printout.
